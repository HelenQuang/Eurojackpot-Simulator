# Eurojackpot Simulator Website

> Our project is a web app that simulates the Eurojackpot lottery. It is built using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, React, Typescript, Material UI, and Stripe Payment. The app allows users to purchase lottery tickets online WITH FAKE MONEY and enter the draw. The algorithm generates winning numbers and determines winners based on the rules of the Eurojackpot. NodeJS and Express provide a RESTful API for the app's backend, handling user authentication, ticket purchases, and lottery draw processing. MongoDB stores user and ticket information, as well as lottery results. The frontend is built with React and Typescript, with Material UI designing the interface. Stripe Payment ensures secure transactions (use Google Pay or Sample Card Information below). Enjoy the lottery experience from home with our reliable and user-friendly app.
